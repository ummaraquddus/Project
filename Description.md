Title:
AI Image Generator

Short Description:
The AI Image Generator is a Django-based web application that leverages Python and HTML to create diverse and dynamic images from text prompts. Utilizing APIs such as MidJourney and DALL-E, this project avoids the need for complex machine learning models by relying on powerful external services.

The application features a comprehensive set of templates for various functions including a home page, login, sign-up, image feed, and prompt input. The user-friendly interface allows for easy navigation and interaction, enabling users to generate any type of image simply by providing a text prompt. Django's robust framework ensures efficient management of these templates and simplifies the codebase, making the development process more streamlined and the application more maintainable.
